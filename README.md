As suggested, this repo is dedicated to my progress with the [Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/frontend-path-c0j) on Scrimba.

Well, you might fairly ask:
> Why so, if Scrimba has their own built-in code editor in the browser and even automatic commits?

And actually there is a number of reasons for this:
1. **DIY approach**: 
     - If I encounter a topic familiar to me (like HTML, CSS, JavaScript), AND only if I have the relevant skill set - I always try to **build the project myself first**. This helps to **improve my development thinking**. Suppose, later on, on my job I am given a project, and is told to implement it, and I actually do it without "hand-holding" - the same thing which I am doing right now with the Scrimba curriculum.
     - As Per Borgen, the founder of Scrimba, said:
       
     > "First make it work, then make it better".
     - It's  a part of Scrimba's ideology that I can **build the actual project first**, no matter how poor the code quality is, but then I would go, watch and learn the whole dedicated part to the project creation - and eventually **refactor my code according to industry standards**.
2. **Control**:
     - In my local development environment I decide what branches I have, what commits I make and when - this is a **real development process**.
3. **Proof of my Git/Github proficiency**:
     - The whole process teaches me how to version control projects, and especially the use case of *many projects in one repo* - aka **monorepo**.
     - For this, I wanted to use [**git submodules**](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules), but decided to opt out for regular .git in the root folder (scrimba-projects) to make it easier, as I am inherently the only person working on this repo, as it is more of a cloud storage and showcase of my work rather than collaboration with others.
